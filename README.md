# goldsky-data-fetch

example repo showcasing data fetching & manipulation & visualization from 3 different subgraphs available on [goldsky](https://goldsky.com/).

these 3 different subgraphs are following:
- [supswap-exchange-v2](https://api.goldsky.com/api/public/project_clrhmyxsvvuao01tu4aqj653e/subgraphs/supswap-exchange-v2/1.0.0/gn)
- [supswap-exchange-v3](https://api.goldsky.com/api/public/project_clrhmyxsvvuao01tu4aqj653e/subgraphs/supswap-exchange-v3/1.0.0/gn)
- [kim-amm](https://api.goldsky.com/api/public/project_clmqdcfcs3f6d2ptj3yp05ndz/subgraphs/kim-amm/0.0.1/gn)

please note that this is mostly to showcase different types of data available and how to use them, hence, a quick and dirty implementation. there can be (actually are) various cleanups & refactors that make sense.
